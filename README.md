# MSc_Research_Project
# This git repository contains the code that I write/wrote for my master's research project in (theoretical) physics at the University of Groningen. 
# The aim of the project is to develop architectures, tools and methods to find (quasi-)symmetries, non-exact symmetries or exact symmetries in different systems. 
# (This description of the project will be updated as the project progresses)
